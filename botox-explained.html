      <h2>What do people usually mean by “Botox”?</h2>
      <p>
        Many people use the word <strong>Botox</strong> as a general term to describe
        anti-wrinkle injections. In everyday conversation, it has become shorthand
        for treatments that soften expression lines caused by muscle movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clinically, however, Botox is a <em>brand name</em>. In medical practice,
        clinicians use prescription-only medicines that work in a similar way, and
        the specific product used is chosen based on clinical assessment rather than branding.

      <h2>Why clinics often avoid brand-led language</h2>
      <p>
        In the UK, anti-wrinkle injections are classed as prescription-only medicines.
        For this reason, responsible clinics focus on the <strong>treatment and outcome</strong>,
        rather than advertising specific brand names.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach keeps the emphasis on safety, suitability, and personalised care —
        not on a one-size-fits-all product.

      <h2>What anti-wrinkle injections actually do</h2>
      <p>
        Anti-wrinkle injections work by temporarily relaxing specific muscles that cause
        dynamic lines, such as frown lines, forehead lines, and crow’s feet.
      </p>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li>Results develop gradually over 3–14 days</li>
        <li>Expressions remain natural when dosing is appropriate</li>
        <li>Effects typically last around 3–4 months</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Treatment is always tailored to your facial anatomy, muscle strength, and goals.

      <h2>Safety, prescribing, and consultation</h2>
      <p>
        At Renew Clinic, all anti-wrinkle treatments follow a clinician-led medical
        assessment. This includes reviewing your medical history, discussing expectations,
        and ensuring the treatment is appropriate for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The medicine is prescribed following assessment, and dosing is individual —
        not standardised.

      <h2>Common myths</h2>
      <ul class="clean">
        <li><strong>“It freezes your face”</strong> — careful dosing preserves expression</li>
        <li><strong>“It’s only cosmetic”</strong> — it can also help jaw clenching and sweating</li>
        <li><strong>“Everyone looks the same”</strong> — personalised plans avoid this</li>
      </ul>
